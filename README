I originally implemented the Ruby solution, but even with the performance
improvements from its original ruby1.9 environment to modern ruby2.2, it's
still very much on the slow side.

I've since ported the implementation to Go and Rust, poorly, and tried naively
to optimize them a little bit. Both are crazy fast in comparison (as long as
you aren't an idiot like me and forget to re-build the Rust binary for
`--release`), but wrestling with types
